# Shrink IW4x

A tool to minimize the size of an IW4x installation specifically for dedicated server use. This tool removes unnecessary assets like textures, sounds, and video files to create a lightweight server installation. The final result will be around 7GB in size.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The resulting installation will be unusable for normal gameplay, as all media assets are removed. Use this only for dedicated server purposes.

## Usage

1. Download the latest release from the releases page
2. Place the executable in your MW2 folder
3. Run the executable

Alternatively, you can specify the MW2 path directly:

```
shrink-iw4x.exe "C:\server\Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2"
```
